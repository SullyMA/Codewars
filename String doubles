String doubles

write a function doubles that will remove double string characters that are adjacent to each other.

For example:

doubles('abbcccdddda') = 'aca', because, from left to right:

a) There is only one 'a' on the left hand side, so it stays.
b) The 2 b's disappear because we are removing double characters that are adjacent. 
c) Of the 3 c's, we remove two. We are only removing doubles. 
d) The 4 d's all disappear, because we first remove the first double, and again we remove the second double.
e) There is only one 'a' at the end, so it stays.



const doubles = string => {
const newArr = [];
for(let element of string){
  if(newArr.length !== 0 && newArr[newArr.length - 1] === element){
    newArr.pop();
  } else {
    newArr.push(element)
  }
}
return newArr.join('');

}
