Beginner Series #3 Sum of Numbers

Given two integers a and b, which can be positive or negative, find the sum of all the numbers between including them too and return it. If the two numbers are equal return a or b.

Note: a and b are not ordered!


const GetSum = (a, b) => {
  let min = Math.min(a, b),
      max = Math.max(a, b);
  return (max - min + 1) * (min + max) / 2;
}

 console.log(getSum(0,-1),-1);
 console.log(getSum(0,1),1);
