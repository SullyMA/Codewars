Balanced Number (Special Numbers Series #1 )

Definition
Balanced number is the number that * The sum of all digits to the left of the middle digit(s) and the sum of all digits to the right of the middle digit(s) are equal*.

Task
Given a number, Find if it is Balanced or not .

Notes
If the number has an odd number of digits then there is only one middle digit, e.g. 92645 has middle digit 6; otherwise, there are two middle digits , e.g. 1301 has middle digits 3 and 0

The middle digit(s) should not be considered when determining whether a number is balanced or not, e.g 413023 is a balanced number because the left sum and right sum are both 5.

Number passed is always Positive .

Return the result as String


const balancedNum = number => {
    let strNum = String(number);
    let sumleft = 0;
    let sumright = 0;
    
    while (strNum.length > 2) {
        sumleft += parseInt(strNum.charAt(0));
        sumright += parseInt(strNum.charAt(strNum.length-1));
        
        strNum = strNum.slice(1, strNum.length -1);
    };
    
    return sumleft === sumright ? "Balanced" : "Not Balanced";
}
