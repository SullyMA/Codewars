7 kyu Alphabet symmetry

Consider the word "abode". We can see that the letter a is in position 1 and b is in position 2. In the alphabet, a and b are also in positions 1 and 2. Notice also that d and e in abode occupy the positions they would occupy in the alphabet, which are positions 4 and 5.

Given an array of words, return an array of the number of letters that occupy their positions in the alphabet for each word. For example,



const solve = arr => {  
  var alphabeth = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz";
  return arr.map(letter => letter.toLowerCase().split('').filter((counter,i) => i === alphabeth.indexOf(counter)).length);
};



console.log(solve(["abode","ABc","xyzD"]),[4,3,1]);
console.log(solve(["abide","ABc","xyz"]),[4,3,0]);
console.log(solve(["IAMDEFANDJKL","thedefgh","xyzDEFghijabc"]),[6, 5, 7]);
console.log(solve(["encode","abc","xyzD","ABmD"]),[1, 3, 1, 3]);
