Tribonacci Sequence


Well met with Fibonacci bigger brother, AKA Tribonacci.

As the name may already reveal, it works basically like a Fibonacci, but summing the last 3 (instead of 2) numbers of the sequence to generate the next. And, worse part of it, regrettably I won't get to hear non-native Italian speakers trying to pronounce it :(

So, if we are to start our Tribonacci sequence with [1, 1, 1] as a starting input (AKA signature), we have this sequence:

[1, 1 ,1, 3, 5, 9, 17, 31, ...]



function tribonacci(signature,n){
  //your code here
  if(signature.length > n) return signature.slice(0, n);
  
  let sum = signature[signature.length - 1] + signature[signature.length - 2 ] + signature[signature.length - 3]
  return tribonacci([...signature, sum], n)
}


console.log(tribonacci([1,1,1],10),[1,1,1,3,5,9,17,31,57,105])
console.log(tribonacci([0,0,1],10),[0,0,1,1,2,4,7,13,24,44])
