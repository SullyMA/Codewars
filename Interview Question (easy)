Interview Question (easy)

You receive the name of a city as a string, and you need to return a string that shows how many times each letter shows up in the string by using asterisks (*).

For example:

"Chicago"  -->  "c:**,h:*,i:*,a:*,g:*,o:*"
As you can see, the letter c is shown only once, but with 2 asterisks.

The return string should include only the letters (not the dashes, spaces, apostrophes, etc). There should be no spaces in the output, and the different letters are separated by a comma (,) as seen in the example above.

Note that the return string must list the letters in order of their first appearance in the original string.

More examples:

"Bangkok"    -->  "b:*,a:*,n:*,g:*,k:**,o:*"
"Las Vegas"  -->  "l:*,a:**,s:**,v:*,e:*,g:*"


const getStrings = (city) => {
    let arr = city.toLowerCase().split('').filter(e => e !== ' ');
    
    let counter = {};
  
    for(let c of arr) {
       counter[c] = (counter[c] || 0) + 1;
    }
  
    let res = [];
  
    for(let letter in counter) {
       res.push(letter + ":" + '*'.repeat(counter[letter]));
    }
    
    return res.join(',');  
  }
